RBAC-Based Multi-User Kubernetes Access Control with Kind Cluster
Designed and implemented secure, namespace-scoped RBAC policies in a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind.

Automated the entire access control setup with a Bash script, including:

Namespace and Role creation (read-only and read-write roles).

Certificate generation for users (john, adam) and signing with Kubernetes CA.

Kubeconfig updates and user-context creation.

RoleBindings mapped to users with strict pod-level permissions.

Deployed test workloads (e.g., NGINX pod) and validated user access using separate kubeconfig contexts.

Demonstrated multi-user access isolation, a critical security practice for real-world production clusters.
