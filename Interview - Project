✅ RBAC-Based Multi-User Kubernetes Access Control with Kind Cluster
🔹Designed and implemented secure, namespace-scoped RBAC policies in a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind.
🔹Automated the entire access control setup with a Bash script, including:
🔹Namespace and Role creation (read-only and read-write roles).
🔹Certificate generation for users (john, adam) and signing with Kubernetes CA.
🔹Kubeconfig updates and user-context creation.
🔹RoleBindings mapped to users with strict pod-level permissions.
🔹Deployed test workloads (e.g., NGINX pod) and validated user access using separate kubeconfig contexts.
🔹Demonstrated multi-user access isolation, a critical security practice for real-world production clusters.
